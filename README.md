# Interview Scheduler

## Introduction
Using the latest tools and techniques, I built and tested a React application that allows users to book and cancel interviews. I combined a concise API with a WebSocket server to build a realtime experience.

This project was completed as part of Week 7 and 8 of the Web Development Bootcamp at [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/).
